 ***   JOB:  Processing job type:

             [0] Process initial tracer conditions: Read in and
                 interpolate tracer fields to SCRUM grid.  Set
                 free-surface, 2D and 3D momentum variables to zero. 


 ***   ZTYPE:   Vertical grid transformation

                [0]  S-coordinate transformation.

                Currently, we support only ZGRID=0.

 ***   TCYCLE:  Time length (days) of climatolgy cycle.  This value is
                only used when JOB=1.  This value is assigned to the
                attribute "cycle_length" of the climatology time 
                variables.  SCRUM uses this value to interpolate between
                time records.  For instance, if the climatology fields
                are monthly averages, TCYCLE=30 days.  This indicates
                a year length of 360 days when cycling through several
                annual climatology cycles.
